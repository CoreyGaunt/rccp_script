# rccp_script

## purpose

- renaming files manually after RCCP shoots is difficult. The ops member needs to have the RCCP spreadsheet open in one tab, and the folder with the images open in another.
They then have to look at the image number, find the corresponding number in the spreadsheet, and look at the products information then rename that image with the corresponding product info.

Yeah it's a lot.

- the purpose of this script is to take out the manual work from the job, and automate it so that this step takes minutes rather than hours

### Notes

- I have heavily commented this code to walk through each aspect of it as it crunches the data
